# Loom UX Review - Web Designer Persona Findings

**Reviewer**: Web Designer Persona
**Date**: 2026-01-18
**Scope**: Loom Web Interface (web/static/)

## Executive Summary

The Loom web interface provides a functional foundation for agent orchestration with a clean, modern design. However, there are several opportunities to improve usability, accessibility, and visual polish. Key areas for improvement include:

1. Enhanced visual feedback for user actions
2. Improved accessibility and keyboard navigation
3. Better mobile responsiveness
4. More informative empty states
5. Enhanced error handling and user feedback

## Detailed Findings

### 1. Accessibility Issues (Priority: P1)

**Issue**: Missing ARIA labels and semantic structure
- Navigation links lack clear ARIA labels for screen readers
- Modal dialogs missing proper ARIA roles and focus management
- Form inputs missing associated labels in some cases
- No skip navigation link for keyboard users

**Issue**: Color contrast may not meet WCAG AA standards
- Need to verify contrast ratios for all text/background combinations
- Status badges (agent statuses) should be tested for contrast

**Issue**: Keyboard navigation incomplete
- Modal close buttons need keyboard focus indicators
- Card interactions (beads, agents, personas) not keyboard accessible
- No visible focus indicators on navigation links

### 2. Usability Improvements (Priority: P2)

**Issue**: Limited visual feedback for actions
- No loading states when data is being fetched
- No success/error notifications for form submissions
- Auto-refresh every 5 seconds happens silently with no indicator
- No visual feedback when spawning an agent

**Issue**: Empty states lack guidance
- "No active agents", "No pending decisions" messages are plain text
- Could include helpful actions like "Spawn your first agent" button
- No visual illustration or guidance for first-time users

**Issue**: Bead and decision details shown via alert()
- Using browser alert() is jarring and non-standard
- Should use a proper modal or slide-out panel
- Cannot copy text easily from alerts
- No ability to view full details with formatting

**Issue**: Form validation and user feedback
- Spawn agent form doesn't show loading state
- No validation messages for required fields before submission
- Error handling shows generic alert() dialogs
- No confirmation messages for destructive actions (agent deletion has confirm but no success feedback)

### 3. Visual Design Enhancements (Priority: P2)

**Issue**: Inconsistent spacing and visual hierarchy
- Section padding could be more consistent
- Bead cards in kanban could use more breathing room
- Agent cards and persona cards have different styling approaches

**Issue**: Limited visual differentiation
- Priority colors (P0, P1) are good but could be more prominent
- Agent status badges could be larger/more visible
- Decision beads blend in with regular beads

**Issue**: Navigation could be more prominent
- Navigation links are small and blend into header
- Active section indication missing (no way to know which section you're viewing)
- Smooth scrolling to sections not implemented

### 4. Responsive Design (Priority: P2)

**Issue**: Mobile experience needs work
- Kanban board switches to single column on mobile (good) but columns are very tall
- Tables and long text may overflow on small screens
- Touch targets may be too small on mobile (buttons, cards)
- Modal dialogs may not fit well on small screens

**Issue**: Breakpoint at 768px is very abrupt
- Could use intermediate breakpoints for tablets
- Grid layouts could be more fluid

### 5. Interaction Design (Priority: P3)

**Issue**: Limited interactive affordances
- Cards have hover state but no indication they're clickable (no cursor pointer on some)
- No drag-and-drop for kanban despite column layout suggesting it
- No inline editing capabilities
- No bulk actions (select multiple beads, agents, etc.)

**Issue**: Real-time updates could be improved
- 5-second polling is good but could show "Updated just now" timestamp
- Could use WebSocket for real-time updates instead of polling
- No optimistic UI updates (changes appear after next poll)

### 6. Information Architecture (Priority: P3)

**Issue**: Flat navigation may not scale
- All sections on one page works now but may not scale with more features
- No breadcrumbs or indication of location
- No search or filter capabilities

**Issue**: Limited bead management
- Can only view beads, not create or edit from UI
- No filtering or sorting options
- No search functionality
- Cannot see bead relationships (parent/child, blocking)

## Recommendations Summary

### High Priority (P1)
1. Add ARIA labels and improve semantic HTML structure
2. Implement keyboard navigation throughout
3. Add proper focus indicators
4. Replace alert() dialogs with proper modals
5. Add loading states for all async operations

### Medium Priority (P2)
6. Create informative empty states with call-to-action buttons
7. Add toast notifications for success/error feedback
8. Improve mobile responsive design and touch targets
9. Add visual indicator for active navigation section
10. Enhance visual hierarchy with better spacing

### Lower Priority (P3)
11. Add search and filter capabilities for beads/agents
12. Implement drag-and-drop for kanban board
13. Add inline editing where appropriate
14. Consider WebSocket for real-time updates
15. Add bulk action capabilities

## Files Requiring Changes

### Immediate Changes Needed:
- `web/static/index.html` - Add ARIA labels, semantic structure, skip nav
- `web/static/css/style.css` - Focus indicators, improved spacing, loading states
- `web/static/js/app.js` - Replace alerts with modals, add loading states, improve error handling

### Future Enhancements:
- Consider component library or design system documentation
- Add accessibility testing to development workflow
- Implement automated contrast checking

## Next Steps

I will file individual beads for each major improvement area with specific implementation suggestions and priorities.
